## :question: FAQ

### What's included in this template?

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [React Native TypeScript Transformer](https://github.com/ds300/react-native-typescript-transformer)
- [Type definitions for React & React Native](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
- [TS Jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest)

This template always uses the latest versions of the dependencies at the time when the `react-native init` command is being executed. This means you don't have to worry about old versions.

Lots of :heart: and credits to the owners and maintainers of those packages.

### Why the setup script?

It deletes obsolete files like the `.flowconfig` and the `setup.js` itself after the setup.

### Does debugging work?

Yes it does.
